Ent provides services and tools via email.

  - Wikipedia
  - Definitions
  - Content of web pages
  - Weather
  - News (NPR, BBC, NYTIMES, FRESHMEAT)
  - UPS tracking information
  - Translation (English/Spanish)

  - c2 wiki

  - Integrated help

How it works:

  - You send mail to an email address
  - This code gets run somehow (I use a cron job)
  - It parses an mbox file. (/var/mail/ent for me)
  - The requests are taken from the subject line
  - Requests can be mixed case
  - The results are emailed back to you and your message is
    removed from the mbox

The code uses several pieces of code written by others. See
the individual files for copyright/license information.

The core Ent code was written by Charles Childers and is
gifted to the public domain.
